# Dragon — Adaptive Integrity System

Dragon is a behavior-aware integrity framework designed to observe automated environments, establish normal runtime patterns, and identify deviations that indicate drift, corruption, or unauthorized influence.

The system focuses on:

- Signed heartbeat verification
- Behavioral baseline modeling
- Integrity drift detection
- Runtime observation and event logging
- Adaptive anomaly signaling

Dragon is part of the Sandbox initiative and continues to evolve through active development and architectural refinement..
