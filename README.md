 # Dragon — Adaptive Integrity System

Dragon is an experimental system designed to observe automated environments, learn normal behavioral patterns, and detect integrity drift or anomalous activity over time.

The project explores:
- Behavioral monitoring
- Integrity verification
- Adaptive anomaly detection
- Secure runtime observation

Dragon is currently in active development as part of the Sandbox initiative.
